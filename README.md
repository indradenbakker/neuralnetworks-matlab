# Neural Networks (2014 course)

During the May 4th National Remembrance Day in 2010 a person started shouting, resulting in a large panic (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfrDGjS3fOo). In this assignment we will try to predict the movement of people after the event, i.e. shouting of a person, occurred. We were given a data set with all relevant points (coordinates of the source, fences and building corners) and of the movement of 35 people during 47 time steps.
